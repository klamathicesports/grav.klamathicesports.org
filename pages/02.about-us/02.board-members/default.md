| ![Lynndsi Ray](https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/photo/44a4-207157499/LRay__large.jpg "Lynndsi Ray") | Hello, I am Lynndsi Ray, and I am grateful to be part of the Ice Hawk Hockey Family. I was born and raised in the Klamath Basin. My boys started skating when they were 3 years old in the Snow Plow Sam lessons and progressed through Learn to Skate, Learn to Play, to the house team, and currently on the travel teams. I fell in love with the program because of the amazing volunteers, coaches, families, and investment in our hockey community. The profound impact these volunteers and coaches have on our players inspired me to become more involved as a hockey mom and now the Youth Hockey Director. |

Outside of hockey, I am a 4th-grade teacher at Henley Elementary and I am passionate about taking care of kids within our community. As a family, we enjoy camping, riding side by side on the coast, and raising livestock at home. In the off-season, my kids show livestock, swim for Klamath Basin Aquatics, and Golf with the Youth PGA Team locally. I believe in creating opportunities to develop well-rounded individuals through a variety of different opportunities as we raise our kids in this amazing community.

My family moved to Klamath Falls in 2004 and, minus a few years living in Washington DC, Washington state, and Colorado, has made Klamath Falls our home. My daughter and I enjoyed figure skating lessons and recreational ice skating for many years. I volunteered on the fundraising committee for several seasons before accepting a position on the Klamath Ice Sports Board of Directors in 2014. Although I rarely skate these days, I have a deep fondness for the Bill Collier Ice Arena and its role in the community.

I have been serving on the board for nearly 5 years. My main connection to the rink has been with the Curling programs. I have led learn-to-curl sessions and have also been a member of the curling league for several seasons. I am a veteran elementary school teacher and have been bringing classes out to the rink for curling field trips for the last 10 years. The Bill Collier Ice Arena is an absolute gem to have in our community and I am dedicated to seeing it enjoyed for generations to come. |

| ![Elvina Contla](https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/photo/530d-206489800/my_portrait_large.jpg "Elvina Contla") | Hi, I'm Elvina Contla, a proud Klamath County resident since 2019. One of the first places that truly brought me joy and ignited my passion here was the Bill Collier Sports Arena. My husband and I started bringing our then 3-year-old for ice skating lessons, and every winter weekend was filled with time at the rink. Both of us grew up roller and inline skating, so when summer came, we couldn’t resist spending our weekends on wheels at the arena. |

Over time, the rink staff became like family, and the arena turned into our second home. It was an honor when I was invited to run the summer “Learn to Roller Skate” programs. Now, I’m thrilled to be heading into my third season teaching roller skating and helping to create unforgettable themed summer nights. My goal has always been to inspire the same passion for skating—whether on ice in the winter or on roller skates in the summer—that has brought so much joy to my life.

The Bill Collier Sports Arena holds a special place in my heart, and I'm grateful for the incredible teens and adults who make it all run smoothly. It’s more than just a rink; it’s a place where families and children can grow, connect, and fall in love with skating, just as I have.
