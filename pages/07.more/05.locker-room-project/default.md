# Pardon Our Progress! 

We are excited to be making improvements to serve our patrons better! During this time, you may notice some construction activity around the arena.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may create and appreciate your patience as we work to enhance our space and improve your experience with us.

Thank you for understanding – we can't wait to share the finished results with you!

# Building the Future

We are thrilled to announce an exciting project to build a new locker room at our ice Arena!

This new  facility will provide a modern, comfortable space for athletes and teams to prepare, fostering a sense of camaraderie and enhancing the overall experience for everyone who steps onto the ice.

This project would not be possible without the generous support of our sponsors. Your contributions are helping to create a lasting impact on our community, supporting athletes of all ages and abilities. We would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all the donors who helped make this project possible. Your support is vital to bringing this vision to life, and we are grateful for your partnership. Together, we are building more than a locker room – we are building a foundation for future successes on and off the ice
