title: Learn to Curl
---

Have you ever watched curling on TV during the Winter Olympics and wondered what the game and yelling were all about and whether you might enjoy trying it?  If interested in becoming a future Olympian or even just learning the basics of the sport, why not come on out to a FREE Learn-to-Curl (LTC) session on
Sunday, November 24th, from 5:00 to 6:00 pm. The capacity for this event is limited to only 30 participants, so reserve your spot now!

In the hour, current members of the local curling club will provide information on the history of the sport and instruction on the basics of the game, including rock delivery, sweeping, scoring, and communication.  Almost immediately, participants can practice throwing rocks and sweeping just as they do on TV.  At the conclusion of the LTC, curlers will be provided with optional next steps on additional practice and how to get involved in league play.

The LTC is open to inquisitive individuals (male and female) of all ages who are comfortable walking/moving about the ice rink.   Pre-teens are welcome, and it is encouraged that they be accompanied on the ice by a parent.  Please know that one is never too old to play this sport!

Participants, apart from a degree of mobility, will need to bring/wear clean-soled shoes (running shoes work well) and gloves/toques as needed, dependent on the ambient temperature.  All curling equipment, including sliders and brooms, will be provided.

If you have any questions before the event about what to expect, please call Ken Billingsley (406-794-6881) or E-mail at: rusarider@gmail.com
