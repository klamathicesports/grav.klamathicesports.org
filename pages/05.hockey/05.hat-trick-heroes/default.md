## What is Hat Trick Heroes?

Think of Hat Trick Heroes as a group of fun-loving hockey enthusiasts that want to keep the game they fell in love with alive, but with a twist-- No high stakes pressure, no intense rivalries, just a fun, relaxed atmosphere where we can just enjoy the sport we love.

Whether you have played your whole life with your BEST BY date in the rear-view mirror, are picking up a hockey stick after a long break, or are brand new, then HAT TRICK HEROES is an opportunity for you to lace up your skates, hit the ice, and play hockey at a more laid-back pace. It's all about camaraderie, staying active, and sharing good times on and off the rink. Join us for a friendly game, where the focus is on fun, fitness, and friendship.

The total cost to register is $100 and this buys you one Sunday session November through March. Envision our monthly skates as a hockey time for between 20-30 like ability players (mostly older-timers); each session will include 2 goalies.
