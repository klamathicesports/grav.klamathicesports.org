He has been involved in various capacities, but most of the time he has been a coach on Gavin's team.  Most recently, he was an 18U Ice Hawks coach and currently serves as Chair of the Hockey Steering Committee.  I have seen a lot of growth within the hockey program ranging from number of hockey players we have to  brand change,  I am very proud to be involved with the Ice Hawks and excited about our future as a program. |

| Hello, I am Lynndsi Ray and I am grateful to be part of the Ice Hawk Hockey Family. I was born and raised in the Klamath Basin. My boys started skating when they were 3 years old in the Snow Plow Sam lessons and progressed through Learn to Skate, Learn to Play, to the house team and currently on the travel teams. I fell in love with the program because of the amazing volunteers, coaches, families and investment in our hockey community. The profound impact these volunteers and coaches have on our players inspired me to become more involved as a hockey mom and now the Youth Hockey Director. | ![Lynndsi Ray](https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/photo/44a4-207157499/LRay__large.jpg "Lynndsi Ray") |

Outside of hockey, I am a 4th grade teacher at Henley Elementary and I am passionate about taking care of kids within our community. As a family, we enjoy camping, riding our side by side on the coast and raising livestock at our home. In the off season my kids show livestock, swim for Klamath Basin Aquatics and Golf with the Youth PGA Team. Locally. I believe in creating opportunities to develop well-rounded individuals through a variety of different opportunities as we raise our kids in this amazing community.
