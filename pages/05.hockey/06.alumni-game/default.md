Attention all Ice Hawk alumni! We are excited to invite you to our 7th annual alumni hockey game being held on Saturday, December 21, from 5 PM to 6:45 PM.

Whether you're lacing up your skates or cheering from the stands, it's an excellent opportunity to reconnect with old teammates and enjoy a night of hockey fun.

Spread the word to your fellow alumni, and let's make it a great night!

## Alumni Dinner

The Machado family is providing a dinner for alumni and coaches after the game. There will be chili, cornbread, and brownies.  Either grab and go or stay and catch up with your team mates and coaches. 

## A note from Coach Gerard; 

If you are a former Ice Hawk player or coach, please join us for our 7th Annual Alumni ICEHAWKS Game on December 21st, 2024, 5:00 to 6:45 pm.

This is an AWESOME event and a special time for all us to reconnect AND to give our families a chance to watch us play together again. Our ICEHAWK alumni (since the first 2004-2005 high school team) is around 90 players and 12 coaches strong. It would be amazing to see as many of you as are in and around town for the holidays in December.

If interested, please fill out the form of interest below. The cost of the game is covered by KIS, Klamath Falls Ice Hawks and the BCIA Adult League.
