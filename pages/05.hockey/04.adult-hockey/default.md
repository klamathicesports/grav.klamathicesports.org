Adult League will be held Thursday nights from 8:20 pm to 9:50 pm, and the first sessions will be on November 14th, 2024.   Adult Drop-in Sunday afternoons is also included in the cost of the registration.  Adult Drop-in will be held twice a month, but times and days may vary, 

_There will be no adult hockey on November 28th , due to the rink being closed for Thanksgiving.  We do have adult league scheduled at its normal time for the two weeks of Christmas break._

Player Information:  The cost is $300 per player; skaters can register for the entire winter adult hockey season or choose to do drop in.  If a player decides to drop in, he or she is responsible for making sure the rink has a copy of their USA Hockey information, as well as being responsible for paying before taking the ice. 

Goalie Information: We have spots for 5 goalies at $200 each; all goalies can sign up for the entire winter adult hockey season or play drop-in.   The same drop-in rules from above apply. 

5-session Alumni/Visitor passes will be available for purchase, for $100, in the skate shack. You will need to provide a copy of your USA Hockey registration upon purchase.
