Our Learn to Skate and Learn to Play hockey classes are designed to teach the basic skating and hockey skills needed to be successful. It is open to girls and boys from the ages of 5 to 99.  

How quickly a skater moves through these classes can vary and can be impacted by many factors, such as how many days a week they are in class or how much they practice outside of class.  Learn to Skate is where they master the basics of skating,  such as starting, stopping, and turning.  In Learn to Play we divide skaters into small groups and they rotate through stations, set up to teach the basics of hockey, such as how to hold a hockey stick and how to pass and skate with a puck. 

Our Learn to Skate and Learn to Play Hockey programs start in October this year and are comprised of 2 separate sessions.  

The first session begins Monday,  November 18th, 2024, and runs through Thursday, January 16th, 2024, with one week off over Thanksgiving break and two weeks off over Christmas break. The second session begins Monday, January 27th, 2025, and ends Thursday, March 13th, 2025, with one week off over President's Day.  You can participate in one session or both of the sessions, whichever fits your family's schedule best.

We offer classes on Monday and Thursday evenings, and you can choose to sign up for one night a week or two, depending on what works best for you and your child.
